#Project Description
Do you have a problem with a Ebook reader that can't read CBR/CBZ files?
But it can read PDF files?

This program is your solution! With two clicks you create your own PDF file from a CBR or a CBZ file.

Any issues with this software? Or you just want to see a new feature? 
Please open a new issue: https://github.com/koen-github/cbr2PDF-Converter/issues So I can look into it.

Usage:

1. Start CBR 2 PDF converter via the start menu
2. Select your CBR File
3. Wait..
4. When the task is done, you get a popup right in your taskbar
5. Output name is in the same location as the CBR file and has the same file name except for *.cbr

Or just right click in Windows Explorer on a CBZ/CBR file to convert it into PDF.

#Other Bugs
+ Better and faster creation of PDF's from CBR's
+ Support for multiple CBR's files
+ Support for converting a whole directory
+ Bug fix for bigger CBR's (some of them don't work because the images are not scaled correctly)


#TODO
1. Fix Bugs
2. Implement new features.
