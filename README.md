# cbr2PDF-Converter
A simple piece of software to convert CBR files into PDF

#Project Description
Do you have a problem with a Ebook reader that can't read CBR/CBZ files?
But it can read PDF files?

This program is your solution! With two clicks you create your own PDF file from a CBR or a CBZ file.
Do you have problems with this software or you just want to see a new feature? 
Please open a new issue: https://github.com/koen-github/cbr2PDF-Converter/issues So I can look into it.


Known Bugs:
- for now the program is in Dutch, but it's not that hard to use.
- Right clicking on a CBR file doesn't work at the moment in windows 8

Usage:

1. Start CBR 2 PDF converter via the start menu
2. Select your CBR File
3. Wait..
4. When the task is done, you get a popup right in your taskbar
5. Output name is in the same location as the CBR file and has the same file name except for *.cbr
