{"name":"Cbr2pdf-converter","tagline":"A simple piece of software to convert CBR files into PDF","body":"### Specifications of CBR 2 PDF converter\r\nDo you have a problem with a Ebook reader that can't read CBR/CBZ files?\r\nBut it can read PDF files?\r\n\r\nHere is your solution!\r\nVery easy to use\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n1. Start CBR 2 PDF converter via the start menu\r\n2. Select your CBR File\r\n3. Wait..\r\n4. When the task is done, you get a popup right in your taskbar\r\n5. Output name is in the same location as the CBR file and has the same file name except for *.cbr\r\n\r\nOr you can just right click a CBR file in Windows Explorer and let the program run.\r\n\r\nSource code will be soon available on github: https://github.com/koen-github/cbr2PDF-Converter \r\n\r\nUpdate: I also added CBZ support in the last version!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### History of CBR 2 PDF converter\r\nA few years ago I started learning C#, this program was an experiment to learn something about C#. After following a lot of tutorials and starting to know a little bit about the new programming language,  I actually build a fully functional CBR to PDF converter.\r\nAfter fixing a few bugs, also to make sure I had something that could be used by other people, I uploaded my CBR to PDF converter onto Sourceforge. Time went by and I didn't looked at it for years,  until a few months ago.\r\n\r\n### The Downloads\r\nA few months ago I found some old files on my backup hard drive. I also found my own written CBR 2 PDF converter, then I realized I had uploaded the program to Sourceforge and went looking if it was still there. \r\nWell, it was. It was downloaded a lot, about 400 downloads a week, for just a simple experiment I wrote to learn a new language. The total downloads were about 88 thousand, I was really amazed. \r\n\r\n### Future progress\r\nI don't have much time to keep this project up to date, but I will try to write some new functions and updates once in a while. If you want to have a special feature you can open a issue on this page: https://github.com/koen-github/cbr2PDF-Converter/issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor: @koen-github\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
