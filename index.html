<p>Do you have a problem with a Ebook reader that can't read CBR/CBZ files?
But it can read PDF files?</p>

<p>Here is your solution!
Very easy to use</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start CBR 2 PDF converter via the start menu</li>
<li>Select your CBR File</li>
<li>Wait..</li>
<li>When the task is done, you get a popup right in your taskbar</li>
<li>Output name is in the same location as the CBR file and has the same file name except for *.cbr</li>
</ol>

<p>Or you can just right click a CBR file in Windows Explorer and let the program run.</p>

<p>Source code will be soon available on github: <a href="https://github.com/koen-github/cbr2PDF-Converter">https://github.com/koen-github/cbr2PDF-Converter</a> </p>

<p>Update: I also added CBZ support in the last version!</p>

<a id="history-of-cbr-2-pdf-converter" class="anchor" href="#history-of-cbr-2-pdf-converter" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History of CBR 2 PDF converter</h3>

<p>A few years ago I started learning C#, this program was an experiment to learn something about C#. After following a lot of tutorials and starting to know a little bit about the new programming language,  I actually build a fully functional CBR to PDF converter.
After fixing a few bugs, also to make sure I had something that could be used by other people, I uploaded my CBR to PDF converter onto Sourceforge. Time went by and I didn't looked at it for years,  until a few months ago.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-downloads" class="anchor" href="#the-downloads" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Downloads</h3>

<p>A few months ago I found some old files on my backup hard drive. I also found my own written CBR 2 PDF converter, then I realized I had uploaded the program to Sourceforge and went looking if it was still there. 
Well, it was. It was downloaded a lot, about 400 downloads a week, for just a simple experiment I wrote to learn a new language. The total downloads were about 88 thousand, I was really amazed. </p>

<p>I don't have much time to keep this project up to date, but I will try to write some new functions and updates once in a while.
