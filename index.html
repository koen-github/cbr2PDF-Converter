<p>A few years ago I started learning C#, this program was an experiment to learn something about C#. After following a lot of tutorials and starting to know a little bit about the new programming language,  I actually build a fully functional CBR to PDF converter.
After fixing a few bugs, also to make sure I had something that could be used by other people, I uploaded my CBR to PDF converter onto Sourceforge. Time went by and I didn't looked at it for years,  until a few months ago.</p>

<p>A few months ago I found some old files on my backup hard drive. I also found my own written CBR 2 PDF converter, then I realized I had uploaded the program to Sourceforge and went looking if it was still there. 
Well, it was. It was downloaded a lot, about 400 downloads a week, for just a simple experiment I wrote to learn a new language. The total downloads were about 88 thousand, I was really amazed. </p>

<p>I don't have much time to keep this project up to date, but I will try to write some new functions and updates once in a while.
